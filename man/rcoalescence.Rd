\title{rcoalescence: Efficient spatial and non-spatial neutral ecology simulator written in C++}
\description{
A convenience wrapper for necsim, a Neutral Ecology Coalescence SIMulator for
spatially-explicit neutral models based in C++.

rcoalescence allows for large-scale simulations to be performed on fully spatial files, with
features to suit a wide variety of use cases.

Four classes exist to represent non-spatial/spatial and non-protracted/protracted simulations.
See \link[=NeutralTreeSimulation]{here} for a full description.

\section{Installation}{

There are several dependencies required before installation of this package will be successful.

\subsection{Dependencies}{

\itemize{
    \item R package development prerequisites, which may require additional installation steps,
    depending on your platform
    \href{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498}{(see here)}.
    \item A C++ compiler that is detectable by R.
    \item The devtools package.
    \item Boost library for C++, available \href{https://www.boost.org/}{here}.
    \item Gdal library for C++, available \href{http://www.gdal.org/}{here}.
    \item Sqlite3 library for C++, available \href{https://www.sqlite.org/index.html}{here}.

    \item Several R packages are dependencies, including Rcpp and BH. These should be installed
    automatically.
}
}

\subsection{Install method}{

First, make sure devtools and the C++ library dependencies are installed. Then run,
\code{library(devtools)}
\code{install_bitbucket("thompsonsed/rcoalescence")}

}
}

\section{Installation issues}{


\subsection{Cannot find C++ compiler}{

For Linux systems, the R development package is required. Use
\code{sudo apt-get install r-base-dev} for Ubuntu-based systems. For other distributions, check
the documentation for installing core software development utilities required for R package
development.

On MacOS, this requires that XCode is installed properly, and the compiler is detectable by R.
See \href{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498}{here} for additional info.

Windows is currently not supported.
}

\subsection{Missing gdal requirements}{

If you get an error about gdal not being detected, check that
gdal is properly installed. If the error indicates missing gdal_priv.h/cpl_conv.h, consider
compiling gdal directly from source, as many package management systems do not properly install
these files. If you know the directory containing gdal, supply it manually to using PKG_LIBS=/dir/
during installation.
}

\subsection{Missing boost requirements}{

Ensure that boost has been properly compiled. Try installing the package BH from CRAN - if this
works then you should be fine. Alternatively, if you know the directory containing boost, supply
it manually to using PKG_LIBS=/dir/ during installation.
}

\subsection{Still facing issues}{

Try downloading the package from bitbucket manually and use \code{install_local()}.
If you have autotools installed, run \code{autoreconf} and \code{autoconf} from the before
attempting package
}

\section{Starting a TreeSimulation}{


Methods are contained within the relevant classes \link[=NeutralTreeSimulation]{(see here)} for
setting up, running and analysing TreeSimulations. The general process is
\itemize{
    \item Create a new \link{TreeSimulation}, \link{SpatialTreeSimulation},
          \link{ProtractedTreeSimulation} or \link{ProtractedSpatialTreeSimulation} object,
          depending on use case.
    \item Set the TreeSimulation parameters and add additional historical maps.
    \item Run the TreeSimulation (generally the most time-consuming step).
    \item Apply speciation rates and other requirements post TreeSimulation using
    SpeciationParameters.
    \item Get the species richness from the TreeSimulation.
    \item Optionally write results to an SQLite database for further manual analysis.
    \item If written to an output database, acquire the desired biodiversity metrics, such as
    species locations or species abundances.

}

See examples in the \link[=NeutralTreeSimulation]{relevant classes}.
