*rcoalescence* is a sister project to [pycoalescence](http://pycoalescence.readthedocs.io/ "pycoalescence documentation") for running spatially-explicit neutral models for ecological systems.


WIP - requires update once package is complete.

### Key Features ###

* Simulate spatially-explicit neutral models with complex map configurations.
* Use varying spatial and temporal sampling regimes to mimic real data.
* Uses coalescence methods for high-performance simulations.
* Convenient, minimalistic code structure.
* Obtain a variety of biodiversity metrics including species richness, species' locations and species abundances.

### Setup and installation ###

* The package can be installed directly from bitbucket using ``install_bitbucket(thompsonsed/rcoalescence)``
* Currently also requires installation of ``necsim``, which is not yet publicly available - please contact authors for more information.
